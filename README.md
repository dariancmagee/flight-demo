# Flight Search Demo

This is a full stack app that allows users to search for origin and destination cities. They can then choose to see the flight 
options for those cities. When the user clicks in the search box, they can either type in an airport name or code to find flights. 

# Challenges:
Getting the local API to conenct to the frontend. I tried creating a local file form the csv file provided, but it would render
the entire country code list when I called it. I wanted to have the results populate when I pressed the "Search" button.

I started over a couple times to try different languages for the final app. I decided to use Node.js and React. I still had a couple other
functions I wanted to add, but this is what it would look like for the user.
