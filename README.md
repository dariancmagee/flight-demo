# flight-demo

Full stack app that allows users to search for origin and destination cities. They can then choose to see the flights 
options for those cities. App was created using Node.js and React. Material UI was also used for certain elements.

#Challenges:
Getting the local API to conenct to the frontend. I tried creating a local file form the csv file provided, but it would render
the entire country code list.

Getting the backend and frontend connected was a little tricky, but I got it working. 

Overall it's just a start to the app. I would like to add another route to see the tabular results for the cities chosen.
